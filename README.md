# Airbnb-Rental-Pricing
In this Kaggle project, the goal was to construct a machine learning model using the given dataset to predict the price of a series of Airbnb rentals. The predicted pricing data is evaluated based on RMSE (root mean square error). This report aims to summarize my data analysis process and showcase the knowledge that I learned from this experience.
